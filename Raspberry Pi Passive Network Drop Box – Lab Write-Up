# Raspberry Pi Passive Network Drop Box – Lab Write-Up

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to build a **passive network monitoring device** using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to observe and analyze normal Ethernet traffic for **Blue Team / defensive security learning**.

The focus of the project was:

- Passive visibility  
- Network traffic analysis  
- Baseline behavior identification  
- Ethical, authorized monitoring  

No active scanning, probing, or exploitation was performed.

## Hardware & Software

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W  
- USB-to-Ethernet adapter  
- MicroSD card  
- Power cable  

### Software
- Raspberry Pi OS  
- `tcpdump`  
- ARPWatch  
- SSH / SCP  
- Wireshark

## Lab Environment

The Raspberry Pi was connected to the local network using Ethernet.  
Remote access was enabled via SSH for management and file transfers.

All monitoring was performed in an **authorized environment**.

---

## Setup Process

1. Installed Raspberry Pi OS on the MicroSD card  
2. Enabled SSH for remote access  
3. Connected the Pi to the network using a USB-to-Ethernet adapter  
4. Verified the Pi received an IP address  
5. Confirmed SSH access from a main computer

## Traffic Capture Configuration

A background service was configured to run `tcpdump` continuously on the Ethernet interface.

Capture settings:

- Interface: `eth0`  
- File rotation: Every **10 minutes**  
- Retention: ~**12 hours** (72 files)  
- Storage location:
